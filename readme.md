# GEOSKY
GEOSKY is a Machine Learning Model that predicts rainfall..

## Tools Used:
Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sklearn, Math, VSCode, Github, Git, Google.

## Inspiration:
I'm building this model after reading of the recent heavy rainfall in Nigeria which has displaced more than 3000 people away from their homes. I currently don't have a dataset with the records of rainfall in Nigeria so i used the one for India!
